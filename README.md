You can run Parcelvoy locally or in the cloud easily using Docker.

To get up and running quickly to try things out, copy our latest `docker-compose.yaml` and `.env` file onto your machine and go!
```
mkdir parcelvoy && cd parcelvoy
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parcelvoy/parcelvoy/master/{.env,docker-compose.yaml}
docker compose up -d # run the Docker container
```

Login to the web app at http://localhost:3000 by entering the default credentials found in your .env file.

```
AUTH_BASIC_USERNAME=parcelvoy
AUTH_BASIC_PASSWORD=password
```

We would recommend changing these default credentials as well as your `APP_SECRET` before ever using Parcelvoy in production.
