## Providers
Providers are the backbone of the product and let you configure how your communications go out. Currently Parcelvoy supports four major types of communications:
- Email
- Text Message
- Push Notification
- Webhook

Between the four of those you should be able to handle just about anything.

Providers are project specific meaning if you have a test and production project, you can have each one setup to use different providers.

<Tip>See the (providers section)[/providers] for more information on each of the provider types we support!</Tip>

## Creating a Provider
To create a provider, nagivate to `Settings -> Providers` under the project you want to add one to. From there click `Add Provider`.

A modal will open which lets you pick from any of our currently supported providers. Selecting one will show you the required fields needed to setup that provider.

Consult any of our (provider pages)[/providers] for more information on getting them setup.
