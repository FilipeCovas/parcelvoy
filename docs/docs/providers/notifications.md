# Push Notifications
Currently Parcelvoy supports sending push notifications to the two largest push notification services (Apple & Google). Since push notifications are a single message type, both services are included inside of a single provider. If you do not wish to send notifications to one platform, just leave that section blank and any devices that fall into the excluded platform will be excluded from sends.
